# suggestions-backend

This is the backend for the Suggestions app. It serves as a learning tool for me, and to, in a near future, publish a tutorial on my blog. 

It uses cookies (cookie-parser), tokens (jsonwebtoken), and encripted passwords(bcryptjs). 

The communication with the mongoDB database is done with mongoose.
